# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Auto Pilot" extension will be documented in this file.

## [9.0.2] - The New Vision
### Rebranding & Philosophy
- **Community First**: We are refocusing on being a community-led, free, and open-source alternative to expensive proprietary tools.
- **Auto Pilot**: Complete rebranding to "Auto Pilot" to emphasize the fully automated, hands-off nature of the agentic workflow.

### Features
- **Enhanced Stability**: Improved background mode logic to handle edge cases and stuck-agent recovery more robustly.
- **Safety First**: Added "Dangerous Command Blocking" to prevent accidental execution of destructive system commands (e.g., `rm -rf /`).
- **Performance**: Optimized polling intervals for better responsiveness without draining battery.

### Fixes
- Addressed various bugs related to multi-window support and state synchronization.
