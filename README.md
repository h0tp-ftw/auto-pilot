# Auto Pilot

## Run 3 AI agents in parallel. Zero babysitting.

Stop watching tabs. Auto Pilot keeps every Antigravity conversation moving — accepting file edits, terminal commands, and recovery prompts automatically.

> **Community fork** — all features unlocked, no paywalls, no subscriptions.

## Why Auto Pilot?

Antigravity's multi-agent workflow is powerful, but it stops every time the agent needs approval.

**That's dozens of interruptions per hour.**

Auto Pilot eliminates the wait:
- ✅ **File edits** — Auto-applied
- ✅ **Terminal commands** — Auto-executed
- ✅ **Retry prompts** — Auto-confirmed
- ✅ **Stuck agents** — Auto-recovered

## Features

### Background Mode
Run multiple Antigravity tabs simultaneously. Every conversation auto-accepts in the background — no tab-switching required.

### Dangerous Command Blocking
Built-in protection against destructive commands like `rm -rf /`. Customize the blocklist from settings.

### Real-time Status Overlay
Visual indicators show conversation state:
- **Purple** — In progress, actively polling
- **Green** — Task completed

### Adjustable Polling Speed
Tune the polling interval from 200ms ultra-low latency to 3s battery-saving mode.

### Multi-window Support
Works across multiple IDE windows simultaneously.

### Works Everywhere
- ✅ Antigravity
- ✅ Cursor
- ✅ VS Code
- ✅ Multiple windows
- ✅ Minimized/unfocused
