## 🚀 Why Auto Pilot?


Antigravity's multi-agent workflow is powerful, but it stops every time the agent needs approval.

**That's dozens of interruptions per hour.**

Auto Pilot eliminates the wait:
- ✅ **File edits** — Auto-applied
- ✅ **Terminal commands** — Auto-executed
- ✅ **Retry prompts** — Auto-confirmed
- ✅ **Stuck agents** — Auto-recovered

---

## ✨ Features


### 🕵️‍♂️ Background Mode

Run multiple Antigravity tabs simultaneously. Every conversation auto-accepts in the background — no tab-switching required.

### 🛡️ Dangerous Command Blocking

Built-in protection against destructive commands like `rm -rf /`. Customize the blocklist from settings.

### 🚥 Real-time Status Overlay

Visual indicators show conversation state:
- **Purple** — In progress, actively polling
- **Green** — Task completed

### ⚡ Adjustable Polling Speed

Tune the polling interval from 200ms ultra-low latency to 3s battery-saving mode.

### 🖥️ Multi-window Support

Works across multiple IDE windows simultaneously.

### 🌐 Works Everywhere

- ✅ Antigravity
- ✅ Cursor
- ✅ VS Code
- ✅ Multiple windows
- ✅ Minimized/unfocused
